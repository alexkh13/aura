        subtitle: 'The Color Wheel Basics',
        text: 'The color wheel is your best friend when learning color coordination. Primary colors (red, blue, yellow) mix to create secondary colors (green, orange, purple), which combine to form tertiary colors. Understanding these relationships helps you create harmonious outfits.'
      },
      {
        subtitle: 'Complementary Colors',
        text: 'Colors opposite each other on the color wheel create dynamic, eye-catching combinations. Think blue and orange, or purple and yellow. These pairings create visual interest and make both colors pop.'

      },

        subtitle: 'Consider Your Skin Tone',

    mainContent: [
      {
        subtitle: 'Start with Similar Colors',

      {
        subtitle: 'The Neutral Buffer',
        text: 'Use solid neutrals to separate busy patterns. A solid blazer over a striped shirt and printed pants, or solid shoes with patterned clothing creates breathing room and balance.'

      },
      {
        subtitle: 'Emphasize Your Favorite Features',
        text: 'Rather than hiding what you don\'t love, highlight what you do. Love your legs? Show them off. Proud of your shoulders? Wear off-shoulder or sleeveless styles. Confidence is the most flattering thing you can wear.'
      },
      {
        subtitle: 'The Power of Fit',
        text: 'Proper fit matters more than body type. Clothes that are too tight or too loose won\'t flatter anyone. Invest in tailoring for a custom fit, especially for key pieces like blazers and pants.'
      },
      {
        subtitle: 'Vertical Lines and Proportions',
        text: 'Vertical lines elongate, while horizontal lines widen. Use this knowledge strategically. Monochromatic outfits create long, lean lines. Breaking up your outfit with different colors creates proportion.'
      },
      {
        subtitle: 'Experiment and Evolve',

      {
        subtitle: 'Quality Over Quantity',

      },
      {
        subtitle: 'Shop Secondhand First',
        text: 'Thrift stores, consignment shops, and online resale platforms offer treasure troves of unique pieces. Buying secondhand reduces demand for new production and keeps clothes out of landfills.'
      },
      {
        subtitle: 'Care for Your Clothes',
        text: 'Proper care extends garment life significantly. Wash less frequently, use cold water, air dry when possible, and repair items instead of replacing them. Small holes and loose buttons are easily fixed.'
      },
      {
        subtitle: 'Choose Sustainable Materials',
        text: 'Look for organic cotton, linen, hemp, Tencel, and recycled materials. These fabrics have lower environmental impacts than conventional cotton or synthetic materials derived from petroleum.'

      },
      {
        subtitle: 'Rent or Swap for Special Occasions',
